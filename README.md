# Hypothyroid-Classification
A comparative study of the performance of various Machine Learning algorithms to classify if a patient has hypothyroid.

Objective
There is a vast difference between the number of specialists to the total number of patients. For instance, the required number of cardiologists in India is as high as 88,000 whereas the actual number is merely 4000.  Hyperthyroidism is a form of thyroid disease,  causing the gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Around 1 in every 100 Americans has hyperthyroid.Â  Through this project, I aim to bridge this gap and make health care more consumer centric, affordable and accessible by using Classification algorithms to aid the clinical decision making process.

Dataset description
The dataset was sourced from UCI Machine Learning repository. It has 3772 rows/objects and 30 columns/features. It has 2 classes (0: no hypothyroid, 1:hypothyroid). 
Patients with hypothyroid: 3481
Patients without hypothyroid: 291

Techniques used: Logistic Regression, KNearst Neighbors, Support Vector Classifer, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Randomized Search, Grid Search, Shapely algorithm, Clustering, Python.
